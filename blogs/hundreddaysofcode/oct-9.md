## Yesterday

I started learning GraphQL from https://www.howtographql.com. It's a pretty nice GraphQL tutorial because they both have video and text format, and so far I've been enjoying it.

## Today

I kept on plowing through https://www.howtographql.com/basics/2-core-concepts/ and learning more about what GraphQL can do.

Here are some of the things I've learned:

### GraphQL

- GraphQL is strongly typed, which means the typing needs to be declared in advance
- GraphQL uses Schema Definition Language (SDL)
- GraphQL uses queries (GET in REST API), mutations (POST, PATCH, DELETE), and subscriptions (something that lets you listen to mutations and returns response objects)
- mutations allow you to specify a payload to retrieve new information in one call round trip
- subscriptions are like data streams, while queries and mutations are similar to the request-response-cycle
- types serve as entry points for request sent by the client side
- a root field is followed by the payload which is flexible and allows you to retrieve which data you want
- it is much more flexible to query nested information using GraphQL compared to REST API

### Scrum

- a Sprint can be canceled by the Product Owner if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
- Product Owners have the option to choose whether to attend a Daily Scrum or not

I'm having a difficulty with getting used to working with the new syntax for GraphQL, since I've been using REST API all this time.

How is everyone doing in their learning journey? Feel free to chat with me in the comments and/via DM!
