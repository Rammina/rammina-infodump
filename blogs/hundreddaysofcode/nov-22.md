Happy new week, everyone!

Today was a really productive day, so I'm fairly pleased. Firstly, my Internet came back so I can finally work how I'd like. I also got a lot of things done, including almost finishing the functionality of my contact form (I got stuck on a bug) and working on the typography and color palette of the entire website. I'm really happy that I'm back on track again.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I decided to focus on fewer things this week so that I can work more efficiently. My main objective is to finish the homepage of my company website before the end of the week.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- almost finished connecting my contact form (frontend) with my AWS serverless backend.
- I got stuck on a bug that gave this error message:

```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT from origin http://localhost:3000 has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

- I will most likely solve this CORS-related bug tomorrow, hopefully it's not too troublesome.

- selected a font-family combination of Raleway (400 and 700) and Roboto Slab for my website
- chose a color palette/theme for my website's design.

### Scrum

- I learned about ways to increase **transparency** among distributed Scrum teams.
- read about the risks of teammates concealing information from each other, especially in work from home environments.
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Have a good day, everyone! I hope you're all doing well.
