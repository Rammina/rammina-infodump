Happy new week, everyone!

Today was a very relaxing day for me. Not much going on besides working on my company website, learning Next.js, studying Scrum, expanding my social network, and planning for the next week.

## Yesterday

Same as usual. I did my 4th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

It's a new week, so I decided on what I will be doing and established my new `Sprint Goals`. My focus for this week will be **Next.js** and **Typescript** as I'm using these technologies for my company website. I'll still be studying **Scrum**, but going to put the guide writing on hold. Finishing my company website is more beneficial to me as of the moment.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- build my company website.
- continued to learn Next.js.
- go through the Typescript documentation at least 30 minutes each day.
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).

Have a great week, everyone!
