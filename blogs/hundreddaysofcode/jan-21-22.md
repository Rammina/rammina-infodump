Hello there, everyone!

Just one thing I will say first: Coding with SQL feels like I'm just writing in English. Anyway, I spent most of my time today learning SQL and going through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). I like this resource because it teaches the concepts in a problem-solving type of way in which you have to retrieve certain data from a table.

Other than that, I also continued to learn about Next.js, specifically about writing dynamic API endpoints.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did various things, such as deploying the updates for my [company website](https://www.rammina.com), learning Next.js, SQL basic concepts, and MySQL.

## Today

### Next.js

- practiced writing dynamic APIs for Next.js.
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- practiced selecting attributes to be retrieved from a table (SELECT and FROM).
- learned how to:
  - filter records using WHERE.
  - combine multiple filter conditions using AND, OR, and the use of () to nest conditions.
  - use IN the specify multiple values in a list when using WHERE clause, and the fact that it is just a shorthand for multiple OR.
  - utilize LIKE in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
    - `%` represents zero, one, or more characters.
    - `_` represents one single character.
  - escape single quotes.

### Scrum

- read this article, titled [Scrum from the trenches - the Sprint Goal by Jasper Alblas](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-trenches-sprint-goal).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
