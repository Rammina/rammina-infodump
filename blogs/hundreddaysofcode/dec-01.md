Hello there, everyone!

It's been 2 days since I last posted on my blog. I was preoccupied with personal life issues, so I was unable to code and interact on social media platforms. It does feel great to get back to coding and blogging again!

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## The Past 2 Days

Unavailable because of personal issues.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- add blurDataURL image placeholders while the actual image is still loading for a better user experience.
- add horizontal rules for section headings.
- fix text overflow on the hero banner.
- updated text color for contact form success message and async button loader for contact form submit.
- setup Netlify deployment (WIP).

I got stuck on this bug:

`Error: Image Optimization using Next.js' default loader is not compatible with next export`

I still don't fully understand why this is the case, but if I am not mistaken, it has to do with `next/image` not working with static pages. I hope I figure it out tomorrow. I might just use `next-optimized-images` library.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I hope everyone's doing well.
