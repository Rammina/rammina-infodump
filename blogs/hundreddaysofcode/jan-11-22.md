Good day, everyone!

It's difficult to balance multiple things at once. However, I need to do so, if I want to make significant progress as a professional developer. Maybe I should improve my time management and force myself to what needs to be done.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I set my goals for this week, which are learning Next.js, updating my website and portfolio, and setting up a workflow that lets me look for work while continuing to build projects and polishing my skills.

## Today

### Company Website

- I worked on my [company website's web development services page](https://www.rammina.com/services/web-dev) and added a hero banner.

### Next.js & SWR

- learned about data fetching in Next.js using SWR.
- went through the first few pages of the [SWR official documentation](https://swr.vercel.app/)

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.

### Work

- created cold e-mail templates for finding contract/subcontract work and contacting businesses/potential clients.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
