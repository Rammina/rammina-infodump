Hello there, everyone!

TIL, SQL index starts with 1, not with 0. I'm really surprised at this fact, because I'm way too used to counting starting from 0 when programming. I find myself easily thrown off when mentally calculating index-related stuff in SQL, because of 1-based index. Either way, it's just something I need to take into account.

That aside, I spent most of my free time today learning string-related functions in MySQL. I didn't learn all of the functions in the [MySQL string functions documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html), but I familiarized them. What I focused on were the most commonly used string functions.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did basic CRUD practice exercises in MySQL to get more used to them.

## Today

### MySQL

- I learned how to utilize the most commonly used string functions in MySQL such as:
  - `CONCAT` - concatenates multiple strings together.
  - `UPPER` - converts a string to uppercase.
  - `LOWER` - converts a string to lowercase.
  - `REVERSE` - reverses the order of characters in a string.
  - `REPLACE` - takes in a string, and replaces substring with another substring.
  - `SUBSTRING` - retrieves a substring from a string, starting and ending indices can be selected.
  - `CHAR_LENGTH` - returns the number of characters in a string.
- skimmed through [MySQL string functions documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/string-functions.html).
- continued [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/).

### Scrum

- continued reading through [An Introduction to the Nexus Framework](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2016-06/An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Nexus%20Framework%20-%20June%202016_0.pdf).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
