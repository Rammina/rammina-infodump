Hello, everyone!

I would like to let you know that my Internet is still dead...

However, I still managed to make some progress by writing code, which I will properly test when my Internet comes back. Another thing I did today was read through three chapters of the Typescript Handbook. Oh well, I need to do whatever I can despite this handicap and impediment!

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report...

## Yesterday

I barely scraped by with whatever learning resources I had that worked off-line, namely my Scrum flashcards and the Typescript handbook.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Typescript

- I finished 3 chapters of the Typescript Handbook.
- reviewed about the common types in Typescript, and learned about the less frequently used ones like `bigint` and `symbol`.
- learned about how Typescript narrows types, and different examples of doing so.
- discovered **discriminated unions**.
- read about the `never` type and how it could be used for exhaustiveness checking.
- learned about _type predicate_.
- understood why `unknown` is better alternative to `any`, because `unknown` because its not legal to do anything with that value.
- learned about _overloading_ and case scenario in which it can be used.

### Next.js

- coded my portfolio section and footer for the homepage.
- all this code wasn't tested properly because of lack of Internet, so that will have to wait.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

I hope my Internet comes back soon...

Have a good day, everyone!
