Good day, everyone!

I finally finished deploying my [business website](https://www.rammina.com/) prototype.

It's nothing amazing, and it is only the homepage so far. I am pretty happy with the color scheme and the functional e-mail contact form, and I think it contains the necessary information for clients to interact with me. I will most likely move on to my personal blog, unless there are urgent bugs that need fixing.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did the initial set up on Netlify deployment for my business website, but it didn't work out because of incompatibility with `next/image`.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- decided to deploy it to Vercel instead of Netlify, because it natively supports `Image Optimization`.
- fixed production bugs with AWS API Gateway CORS (I didn't add the domain address to the allowed list).
- add custom Error 404 page.
- replace favicon image with the company logo.
- add optimized link tag for Google fonts.
- fixed missing image placeholders.
- remove unnecessary files.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I hope everyone's doing well.
