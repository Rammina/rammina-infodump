Hello there, everyone!

Today was an irregular Tuesday for me. Firstly, my physical therapy session was canceled because of a heavy flash flood the previous day. I wasn't sure what to do with my extra four hours for the day. I'm a person who lets my own routine guide my day-to-day life, so it feels really weird when things go differently from the usual.

I spent that time doing research on "The 3C of User Stories" which I intend to add as another section inside my [user story guide](https://dev.to/rammina/the-art-of-writing-agile-user-stories-17o9). I think I will update it tomorrow.

I also found some weird paragraphs on my user story guide, which I corrected so that it reads smoothly.

## Yesterday

I posted the initial draft for my guide, ["The Art of Writing Agile User Stories"](https://dev.to/rammina/the-art-of-writing-agile-user-stories-17o9). I'm really happy and grateful that it was successful and well-received. It's actually the first serious guide I uploaded on this platform, so I was pretty worried about it. Thank you to everyone who supported me!

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Scrum

- read up on _the 3C of User Stories_.
- according to the above, a user story should have:
  - `Card` - a written description of the story to be used for estimation and planning.
  - `Conversation` - ensure a clear understanding by discussing with others. This can be through asking questions, sharing ideas, and working toward solutions.
  - `Confirmation` - agree upon what to build, then record the said agreement. This allows for confirmation tests to ensure that the user story is completed.
- did more practice quizzes on Scrum (almost finished with Lapshin's quizzes, so I might have to get a different set soon).

Thank you once again for everyone's support! I wish you all the best, and have a good day.
