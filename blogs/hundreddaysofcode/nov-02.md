Greetings!

Today, I went out for my Physical Therapy session so I couldn't spend much time coding. However, I got 3 hours in, which I'm pretty content with for a day with impediments. I also started planning for the requirements and features of my company's website, so I wrote some user stories along with another developer today.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I learned about two forms of rendering in Next.js. Also, I read about `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getServerSideProps`. I kept on pushing through Scrum and XP from the Trenches.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- **Web crawlers** are used by search engines to navigate a website to discover other websites and its pages.
- Here is how the Googlebot indexes webpages:
  - find URLs
  - add the URLs to the Crawl Queue
  - make an HTTP request
  - Render Queue
  - if all criteria are met, the page may be indexed and shown in search results.
- There are 4 rendering strategies in Next.js:
  - **Static Generation** - the page HTML is generated during _build time_.
  - **Server-side Rendering** - the page HTML is generated during _each request_.
  - **Incremental Static Generation** - static generation on a page-by-page basis.
  - **Client-side Rendering** - websites are rendered entirely using JavaScript.
- I learned more about crawling and indexing, including status codes, robots.txt, XML sitemaps, special tags, and canonical tags.

### Scrum

- wrote user stories for my company website.
- I continued to read [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- part-time team members in Scrum are rarely a good idea.
- rearranging teams between sprints are best done at the beginning and only for long-term changes afterwards.
- cross-component teams tend to be better most of the time than component-specialized teams.
- synchronizing the sprints of multiple teams is better than overlapping.

I really had a great time today, even if the day felt really short!

I hope everyone's doing well!
