Hello there, everyone!

Today, I was mostly working on mundane coding tasks and didn't learn new exciting stuff. I'm not complaining because I was still productive. I spent most of the time adding Contact sections at the bottom of each page of my website, to reduce the number of broken links. Another thing I did was refactoring and reducing redundant code. Finally, I worked on a reusable hero banner component, because the design is mostly the same for each section, with only the text and image being different.

Another thing I'd like to share is that my free Ghost plan died on me from running out of memory (JawsDB only gave me free 5MB).

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I learned about **OpenGraph** and its Twitter equivalent, and used `next-seo` to make my work easier. I also made temporary placeholder sections.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- added a Contact section at the bottom of each page.
- refactor code to be more DRY and remove redundant code.
- in the middle of creating a reusable hero banner component.
- troubleshooting why the Ghost content management wouldn't work.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I wish you the best.
