Happy Halloween, everyone!

Today's a special occasion, so I didn't code that much. I only did like 2-3 hours of productive work to respect the challenge, then the rest was pretty chill. Glad to finally have a chance to unwind from constant daily routine!

### Halloween? Not for me.

We don't really do trick or treat where I live, and I'm not too big into going out to celebrate. Instead, I just chilled and watched anime, gaming streams, and played FF14. I'm such a geek, I know. It's what makes me happy so I don't really feel pressured to go to horror houses or put on costumes.

That said, I do hope that everyone had a fun Halloween!

## Yesterday

Like I usually do every week. I did my Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

Just as like every new week, I planned out what I should be doing and established my new `Sprint Goals`. My focus for this week will be **Next.js** as I would like to build my company's website soon. I will still be studying **Scrum** and continue writing my guides!

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- learn and review Next.js.
- lay out my plans for my company's website.
- write user stories for my website, so I can plan ahead and prioritize what features I will really need right away and what might be desirable in the future.
- finish my beginner Scrum guide.
- finish reading [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- finish my guides about Scrum.
- continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).

Trick or treat! Have fun, everyone!
