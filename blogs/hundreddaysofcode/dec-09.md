Hello there, everyone!

I'm making decent progress with designing [the Rammina company site](https://www.rammina.com/)'s blog! It's been a long time since I've enjoyed working on a project. I'm pretty happy with what I've done so far.

Here is a comparison of what the page looks like earlier this morning and what it looks like now.

I think it's looking pretty nice, I'm excited to work on it again tomorrow! I will most likely deploy it on the weekend, regardless of its completion.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I finished connecting my blog's Next.js frontend with the Ghost headless CMS using Content API.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Blog

- styled my [company page blog](https://www.rammina.com/) homepage and specific blog post page.
- learned about `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and utilized it to insert the blog post data inside a `<div>`.
- discovered some really nice open-source Ghost themes, Editorial being my favorite.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I hope everyone's doing well.
