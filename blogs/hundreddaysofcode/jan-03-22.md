Hello there, everyone!

I have great news to share, it's that I passed the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam and I'm now a certified **Scrumbag**. I passed with a score of 92.5%. Does this mean I'm ready to work as a Scrum Master? No, not at all. I'm just familiar with the concepts and mechanisms of the Scrum framework, and that's all there is to it. It takes way more than just studying for an exam to be a great Scrum Master.

Also, I planned out what I'll be doing for this week, a lot of work related to improving my company site.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I got a lot of stuff done, which included adding an [Affiliates page](https://www.rammina.com/affiliates) for my company site, fixed a bug in which there were two footers in the error page, replaced my Ghost CMS with a new one, and added Github repository links to each of my projects in the [Portfolio page](https://www.rammina.com/portfolio).

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on polishing the design of my [company site](https://www.rammina.com), adding more sections to certain pages, bug fixes, and other enhancements.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Company Website

#### Higher Priority

- add more details to portfolio projects, like a "View More Details" that shows on a modal the technology stack and features of a specific project.
- add more sections to other pages and make them more detailed:
  - the [Services page](https://www.rammina.com/services) could include specific sections for "Website Development," such as Frontend Web Development and Backend Web Development, what kind of technology stacks are used, and so on.
  - Digital advertising, for example, could include different types of services and techniques such as email marketing, social media marketing, and the likes.
  - Writing also could include different types of writing services, including articles, blogs, and etc.
- add a small subsection on the Contact section that says something like "or you can contact us via e-mail at ramminadevdesign@gmail.com or call us on number" below the submit button for the form.

#### Lower Priority

- add tags functionality for each blog post to make it easier to categorize.
- add lazy loading and infinite scrolling for all blog posts page (so data that is loaded by batches to reduce build time).
- add pages for different users and authors.
- allow registered users to comment on blog posts (going to use Disqus).
- add quality-of-life features:
  - filtering by tags
  - search functionality
  - sort blog posts and authors
- add share on social media button (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) for each blog post.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.
- will be put to the sideline now that I have already passed the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
