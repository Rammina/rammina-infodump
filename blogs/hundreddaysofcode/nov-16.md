Hello there, everyone!

Like every Tuesday, I had to visit my physical therapist. It's a bit unfortunate that I couldn't work on much today, but I managed to get a good amount of work done.

I was mostly working on the services and portfolio sections of my homepage.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I worked on my services section yesterday, in which I finished the skeleton layout for mobile.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- coded my services and portfolio sections for the homepage.
- skeletons are mostly there, but design is temporary and will be improved.

EDIT: Apparently, Next.js `<Image />` has `objectFit="cover"` as an attribute, which is helpful in making images more responsive by retaining aspect ratio is much as possible.

### Scrum

- I'm reading some resources on Scrum.org on my downtime.
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Have a great start to your week, everyone!
