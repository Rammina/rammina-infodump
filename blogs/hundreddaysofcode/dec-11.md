Happy weekend, everyone!

This week is also one of the least productive ones in this challenge. However, I'm pretty satisfied with how my professional blog is heading towards, so that kind of evens it out. I'm hoping that the next week is productive, because the Christmas holiday getting closer.

Let's move on to my weekly retrospective!

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- code my blog's Next.js frontend.
- setup Ghost headless CMS.
- have the frontend communicate with Ghost Content API.
- fix the bugs in my company website.
- continue to learn Next.js and Typescript by using concepts while I build my blog or maybe just from reading documentations.
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- continue networking.

## Weekly Review

Here are the things I've managed to do:

- connected the [Rammina development blog](https://www.rammina.com/)'s Next.js frontend with GhostContentAPI.
- setup Ghost headless CMS.
- style the blog homepage, as well as a specific blog post's page.
- fix some of the bugs in my company website.
- learned more about Next.js, GhostContentAPI, and Typescript while working on the blog.
- continue my studies for PSM I (not by much).
- expanded my network.

## Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

- I finally got my professional blog working.
- learn plenty regarding Ghost and Next.js.
- discovered a little bit more about Typescript.
- expanded my network a little bit more.

### Some Mistakes I've Made

- I still had days where I didn't code at all.
- I pretty much neglected studying Typescript and Scrum.
- got distracted at times and couldn't focus much.

### Things I Could Improve On

- learn a little bit even if it's not much, on bad days.
- be more disciplined with learning new things every day.
- prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.
- try to automate the things I don't really have to do myself.
- make some of my chores a lot easier to do in terms of workflow.
- I should DEFINITELY install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.
