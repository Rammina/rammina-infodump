Happy weekend, everyone!

Today, I spent most of the day learning MySQL. I dive deeper into various data types in SQL as well as their respective functions. Also, I learned about how logical operators in MySQL work, which isn't that different from how they work in other programming languages. One interesting thing I noticed is that string comparison in SQL is not case sensitive.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I practiced utilizing aggregate functions in MySQL and learned more about the Nexus framework.

## Today

### MySQL

- I learned about more datatypes in SQL and their use cases such as `CHAR`, `DECIMAL`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, and `TIMESTAMP`.
- practiced various `DATETIME` utility functions such as:
  - `DATE_FORMAT`
  - `NOW()`
  - `CURDATE()`
  - `CURTIME()`
  - `DAY`
  - `DAYNAME`
  - `DATE_ADD`
  - `DATE_SUB` and more...
- learned about logical operators in MySQL, the common ones and interesting ones like `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `IN`, and more.
- practiced using `CASE` statements for conditionally returning different values based on conditions.
- continued [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/).

### Scrum

- continued reading through [An Introduction to the Nexus Framework](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2016-06/An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Nexus%20Framework%20-%20June%202016_0.pdf).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
