Greetings, everyone!

Just like every Tuesday, I had to go out for my physical therapy session, so I couldn't work as much today. However, I still managed to get a decent amount of work done on my [company webpage](https://www.rammina.com) such as adding alternative contact methods in case the message form doesn't work and adding a hover overlay on the portfolio project images that says "View Project."

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I passed my Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam and got certified. Also, I planned out the work I'll be doing for this week, mostly regarding the business page.

## Today

### Company Website

- I added call-to-action for alternative contact methods, specifically email and phone number, if ever the contact form doesn't work.
- I placed a hover overlay on top of the portfolio project images.

### Scrum

<!--  -->

- read some articles about Scrum, particularly about the role expectations in an organization, as well as other people's experiences of being a Developer and Scrum Master at the same time.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
