Greetings! I hope everyone is doing well.

Today is a rather "normal" day. I updated my guide like I promised yesterday. I did a lot of networking today, reaching out to people in various social media. Facebook is something I've been procrastinating for a while now, I don't know why I keep avoiding that platform. Maybe the culture is just not a good match for me?

Anyway, moving on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I read about _the 3C of User Stories_, edited my guide, and did more practice quizzes on Scrum.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Scrum

- read more about how [not everything has to be a user story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/not-everything-needs-to-be-a-user-story-using-fdd-features).
- there are cases in which user stories are not necessary, like internal company projects, projects for technical people, and personal projects.
- When a Sprint is cancelled:
  - any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed.
  - if part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it.
  - all incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.
- the three pillars that uphold Scrum are:
  - transparency
  - inspection
  - adaptation
- did some practice flashcards for Scrum.

Thank you once again for everyone's support! I wish you all the best, and have a good day.
