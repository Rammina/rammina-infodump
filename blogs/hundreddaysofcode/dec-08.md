Good day, everyone!

I'm back from my two days of inactivity. Today was a fairly great start, I managed to connect the [Rammina business page](https://www.rammina.com/) Next.js frontend with my Ghost headless CMS. I'm pretty glad to be coding again!

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## The past two days

I took a break from work and coding. I was spending time with my family.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- connected my [company page](https://www.rammina.com/)'s Next.js frontend with Ghost CMS.
- I learned a lot about `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.
- got some Typescript learning in from using the Next.js and Ghost Content API built-in functions.
- learned some methods in Ghost Content API.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I hope everyone's doing well.
