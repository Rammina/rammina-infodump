Hello there, everyone!

This week, I'm planning to learn more about SQL, MySQL, Next.js, and Scrum, as well as finish building the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages for my website. Maybe I will deploy the updates at the end of the week, if they are ready.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did my 12th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on learning SQL/MySQL Next.js, Scrum, and SWR, and updating my website.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Company Website

- code the content and design of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages for my website.
- deploy the updates after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them.

### SQL/MySQL

- learn more SQL concepts by going through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).
- familiarize myself with the tools of MySQL and how to use them.

### Next.js

- continue learning by reading the Next.js documentation.
- continue going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
- learn SWR and go through the documentation.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
