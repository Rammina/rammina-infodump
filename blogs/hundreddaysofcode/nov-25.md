Greetings, everyone!

Today was a really easy day in terms of work. All I had to deal with was SCSS styling for my entire homepage. It's still a work in progress, and I still have three sections that need to be patched up.

I'm fairly pleased with what I've done as well, but it is far from the ideal output for me. There is so much more that this could improve upon, but if I truly want to deploy my first MVP by the end of the week, then I can't be too picky.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I squashed this bug:

`Access to XMLHttpRequest at API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT from origin http://localhost:3000 has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource `

Also, I started working again on the other parts of the website besides the contact form.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- I fixed the styling for a lot of the sections of the website.
- added images in their appropriate locations.
- wrote text content for the Services section of the homepage.
- fixed the images on the footer.
- add some hover effects for links and buttons.

### Scrum

- I learned about Scrumban, which is a method for moving from Scrum as a starting point towards Kanban.
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day.
