Hello there, everyone!

I wasn't not productive today, but at least I finished the part I was working on for the [Rammina company website](https://www.rammina.com). What I completed was a component for a specific portfolio project page, which only requires a few properties filled in to turn into a separate page. Here is a sample, which is for my [RestoFund project page](https://www.rammina.com/portfolio/resto-fund).

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

- added individual portfolio project page component with details through properties (WIP).
- wasted some time creating a Modal component that I probably won't use for a while.

## Today

### Company Website

- finished mobile and desktop designs for my specific portfolio project page component.

### Scrum

- read another article about Scrum, titled [The 2 Best Scrum Masters I Ever Worked With - The Master Of Coaching And Facilitation](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-8-scrum-master-junior-agile-coach) by [Barry Overeem](https://theliberators.com/).
- the article talked about an example of someone who was a great Scrum Master through observing someone who was in that role and embodying of their qualities.
- said person also didn't have much experience with Scrum/IT in general, but did a good job of helping his team come up with solutions (instead of telling them what to do) by facilitating interactions.

### SEO

- I watched a video from Ahrefs about [increasing Domain Authority rankings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl1Ch9ARdQs).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
