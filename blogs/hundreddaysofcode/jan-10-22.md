Hello there, everyone!

Today, I planned out my Weekly Sprint Goals as well as updated my professional profiles on various platforms. I intend to focus more on learning new skills for this week, while working on my projects. Also, I will be actively looking for work, so I need to set up a workflow and templates to be able to do everything efficiently.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

Just like I do every weekend, I did my 10th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on learning Next.js, updating my website and portfolio, and setting up a workflow that lets me look for work while continuing to build projects and polishing my skills.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Job Searching

- make reusable templates for answering a job application questions.
- create a template for cold outreach for looking for contract/subcontract work.
- make reusable templates for cold e-mailing businesses to let me work for them (searching for clients).

### Company Website

- add more sections to other pages and make them more detailed:
  - the [Services page](https://www.rammina.com/services) could include specific sections for "Website Development," such as Frontend Web Development and Backend Web Development, what kind of technology stacks are used, and so on.
  - Digital advertising, for example, could include different types of services and techniques such as email marketing, social media marketing, and the likes.
  - Writing also could include different types of writing services, including articles, blogs, and etc.

### Next.js

- continue learning by reading the Next.js documentation.
- continue going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
- learn about SWR and go through the documentation.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
