Happy Sunday, everyone!

Today, I managed to finish deploying the prototype of my business' [web development blog](https://www.rammina.com/blog). I'm fairly pleased with how it came out! That might be an understatement, because this is one of the projects I really cared about.

I also wrote down my initial plan for things to work on this week, particularly things I need to do for the blog site.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

Just like I do every weekend, I did my 9th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on my [professional blog](https://www.rammina.com/blog)'s deployment, bug fixes, and enhancements.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Company Website

- deploy the first prototype/MVP of the [Rammina company site](https://www.rammina.com/)'s blog.
- fix any bugs that arise, both pre-deployment and after deployment to production.
- use proper meta-tags for better SEO, most likely will utilize [next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) to make this easier.
- add tags functionality for each blog post to make it easier to categorize.
- add lazy loading and infinite scrolling for all blog posts page (so data that is loaded by batches to reduce build time).
- add pages for different users and authors.
- allow registered users to comment on blog posts (going to use Disqus).
- add quality-of-life features:
  - filtering by tags
  - search functionality
  - sort blog posts and authors
- add share on social media button (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) for each blog post.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum again.
- keep reviewing the Scrum guide, Scrum flashcards, and other resources.

Have a great week, everyone!

Thank you for reading! I hope everyone's doing well.
