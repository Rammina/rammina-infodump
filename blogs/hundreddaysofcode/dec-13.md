Greetings, everyone!

Today, I fixed multiple production bugs in my [company website's blog](https://www.rammina.com/blog), as well as made some style changes. I redeployed it again today, and I am really happy with how it turned out. Of course, there is still a lot of room for improvement and this is far from being a finished product. That said, I've made something that provides business value which I'm proud of.

## Showcase

Here are some images of how it looks like:

I can't wait to work on it again and make more improvements!

## Blog Technology Stack

For those curious about the technology stack that I used for the blog site:

Frontend

- Next.js (production-ready React framework)
- SCSS modules (preventing styling collisions)

Backend

- Ghost on Heroku (headless CMS for the blogs)

API

- GhostContentAPI

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I planned out what I will be doing for this week and declared my **Sprint Goals**.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Blog

- fix production bugs on my [Web Development blog](https://www.rammina.com/blog).
- changed some styling for the blog, specifically the buttons and some margins.
- moved `<Layout>` outside of a page component and have it wrap around the `<Component>` tag in `_app.js`.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! Have a great week.
