Good day, everyone!

Today, I spent most of the day coding and working on the [Rammina company website](https://www.rammina.com).

While I worked on the site for several hours, I wasted some time going in circles and wasn't the most efficient. One mistake I made was creating a Modal component that I'm probably not using anytime soon. I realized after working, that it makes more sense to create an individual page for a project item instead. If I planned out my work instead of just jumping right into it, I would probably have saved myself 2-3 hours worth of work.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

- added alternative contact methods in case the message form doesn't work.
- modified the hover effect on portfolio project images.

## Today

### Company Website

- added individual portfolio project page with details (WIP).
- created Modal component (that I probably won't use for a while).

### Scrum

- read an article about Scrum, titled [The Scrum Master is a Junior Agile Coach](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-8-scrum-master-junior-agile-coach) by [Barry Overeem](https://theliberators.com/).
- learned that:
  - Effective change is driven from “the inside-out”. The Scrum Master - being part of the Scrum Team - is in a better position to facilitate this change than an (external) Agile Coach. This is also how the Scrum Guide intended the role of the Scrum Master.
  - When organizations choose to implement an empirical process primarily through Scrum, there should be almost no need for Agile Coaches.
  - Instead, Scrum Masters should be enabled and supported to promote the empirical process on all levels of the organisation. If they can, and if they do, no other roles are necessary to help organizations generate valuable outcomes through Scrum.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
