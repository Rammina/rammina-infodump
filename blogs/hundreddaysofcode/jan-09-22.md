Happy weekend, everyone!

Today marks the end of first week of the year, and I was off to a fairly productive start! I managed to get a lot of things done with regards to my [company website](https://www.rammina.com), professional networking, job searching, and so on. Overall, it went fairly well, but there are things that could be improved upon.

There are still so many features I can add to my company website, but they are not necessary or needed currently. I will most likely put them on the backburner for the coming weeks.

Let's move on to my weekly retrospective!

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Company Website

#### Higher Priority

- add more details to portfolio projects, like a "View More Details" that shows on a modal the technology stack and features of a specific project.
- add more sections to other pages and make them more detailed:
  - the [Services page](https://www.rammina.com/services) could include specific sections for "Website Development," such as Frontend Web Development and Backend Web Development, what kind of technology stacks are used, and so on.
  - Digital advertising, for example, could include different types of services and techniques such as email marketing, social media marketing, and the likes.
  - Writing also could include different types of writing services, including articles, blogs, and etc.
- add a small subsection on the Contact section that says something like "or you can contact us via e-mail at ramminadevdesign@gmail.com or call us on number" below the submit button for the form.

#### Lower Priority

- add tags functionality for each blog post to make it easier to categorize.
- add lazy loading and infinite scrolling for all blog posts page (so data that is loaded by batches to reduce build time).
- add pages for different users and authors.
- allow registered users to comment on blog posts (going to use Disqus).
- add quality-of-life features:
  - filtering by tags
  - search functionality
  - sort blog posts and authors
- add share on social media button (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) for each blog post.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.

## Weekly Review

Here are the things I've managed to do:

- add a specific project details page for each individual portfolio project, like [RestoFund](https://www.rammina.com/resto-fund).
- attach alternative contact methods subsection for the [Contact section](https://www.rammina.com/#contact), such as e-mail and contact number.
- fix some of the bugs in my company website.
- learned a little bit more about Next.js.
- continued studying Scrum.
- expanded my network.
- I installed a Website Blocker Chrome extension to minimize distractions.

## Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

- I now have a page about the details for each project.
- there are now ways to contact me in case the message form does not work.
- cleaned up my website and fixed some bugs.
- continued learning Next.js and Scrum.
- expanded my network a little bit more.
- finally installed that website blocker that I've been procrastinating for months.

### Some Mistakes I've Made

- I still had days where I didn't code much.
- I pretty much neglected studying Typescript.
- I could learn more Next.js, by going through the documentation as I work.
- got distracted at times and couldn't focus much.
- I'm currently overwhelmed by the amount of choices I have, leading to analysis paralysis and I have hours when I go in circles without doing much.

### Things I Could Improve On

- focus my attention on my current priorities.
- be more disciplined with learning new things every day.
- prioritize the tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.
- learn a little bit even if it's not much, on bad days.
- make some of my chores a lot easier to do in terms of workflow.
- try to automate the things I don't really have to do myself.
- avoid doing things that make me lazy, such as laying down on bed.
