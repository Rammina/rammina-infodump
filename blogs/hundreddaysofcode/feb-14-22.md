Happy Valentine's Day, everyone!

I love coding, so it's my Valentine and I spent all day just doing that. Jokes aside, I took a relatively easy day today, spending time with my loved ones and having a bit of fun. Coding may be enjoyable, but I didn't want to grind all day on a special occasion.

Moving on, I reviewed various types of table **_relationships_** and the different types of JOINs, just so that I have a clearer understanding of them. Honestly, it's going to take me some time to intuitively understand when to use one over the others, but I suppose I should just practice more.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

Grinded real hard learning about more complex data types, `DATETIME` utility functions, and logical operators in MySQL.

## Today

### MySQL

- practiced using SQL `JOIN` to generate meaningful data by combining multiple relational tables.
- reviewed the different types of `JOIN`s:
  - `INNER JOIN` - INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied.
  - `LEFT JOIN` - returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the `JOIN` and matching rows for the table on the right side of `JOIN`.
  - `RIGHT JOIN` - returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the `JOIN` and matching rows for the table on the left side of `JOIN`.
  - `FULL JOIN` - creates the result-set by combining result of both `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. The result-set will contain all the rows from both the tables.
- continued [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/).

### Scrum

- finished reading [An Introduction to the Nexus Framework](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2016-06/An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Nexus%20Framework%20-%20June%202016_0.pdf).
