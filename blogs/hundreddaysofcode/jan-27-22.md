Greetings, everyone!

Today, I worked on a lot of different things. I made some progress with learning SQL and Next.js as well as coding the Terms of Use page for my business site. Not too bad I'd say.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I set my goals for this week, which are:

- finish the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages, and then deploy them.
- learning more SQL, Next.js, and Scrum.

## Today

### Next.js

- learned how to render markdown as JSX.
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- practice doing nested SELECTs.
- learn more about how correlated subqueries work.
- learned how to use aggregate functions, SUM and COUNT.
- continued to go through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- read this article, titled [Myth 3: In Scrum, releases are done only at the end of the Sprint by Barry Overeem](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/myth-3-scrum-releases-are-done-only-end-sprint).
- it is okay to release updates to production even before the Sprint Review.
- it is recommended to keep expanding the Definition of Done (DoD).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
