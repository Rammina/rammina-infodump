Greetings, everyone!

Not much free time today, but at least I finished coding all of the services pages for my [business site](https://www.rammina.com). I've also tested and deployed all of them, so here are the three of them:

- [Web Development page](https://www.rammina.com/services/web-dev)
- [Digital Marketing page](https://www.rammina.com/services/digital-marketing)
- [Writing page](https://www.rammina.com/services/writing)

As for learning, I did a little bit of practice with Next.js, especially with writing API function handlers on the `/pages/api` folder.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did various things, such as working on my [company website](https://www.rammina.com), learning Next.js, and picking up MySQL.

## Today

### Company Website

- finished coding the services-related pages.
- did some testing and checking before deploying the updates to production.

### Next.js

- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### Scrum

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
