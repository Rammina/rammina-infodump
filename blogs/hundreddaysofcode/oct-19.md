Greetings, everyone!

It's Tuesday, and it's unfortunate that I won't be able to be as productive today because of my weekly physical therapy session. That said, I shall try my best to fulfill the minimum requirements of the challenge!

## Yesterday

I finished the draft of the introduction of my Scrum Guide for beginners.

## Today

### Scrum

- wrote about how the members of a Scrum Team function individually as well as their interactions with the others (still missing the Scrum Master section).
- read about traits that makes someone suitable for each role in a Scrum Team.
- looked into how businesses misuse Agile and Scrum in their operations.

### GraphQL

- review concepts I've learned last week.
- look deeper into how GraphQL differs from REST API, and which scenarios one should be used over the other.
