Happy weekend, everyone!

Another productive day for me. I worked on my website, practiced for interviews, and reviewed Node.js as well as other backend concepts and tools.

I finished building another page for my website today, which was about the Digital Marketing Services. The design and layout are similar to the Web Development Services page, which kind of works for now. I only have one more page left for the Services pages, which I'm looking forward to finish in the coming days.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

- I finished building the Web Development Services page for my [web development site](https://www.rammina.com) and continued to learn more about Scrum.
