Hello there, everyone!

Today, I almost finished the skeleton layout for my entire homepage. Now, I just need to design the homepage and look for images to use for styling. I've made a decent amount of progress so far, so I'm fairly pleased.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I finished most of the contact form's skeleton, added state management, and validation.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- fixed bugs on displaying error messages for the input fields.
- fixed broken CSS styling and classNames.
- add footer skeleton layout.
- add styling for different breakpoints.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Have a good day, everyone! Thank you for reading.
