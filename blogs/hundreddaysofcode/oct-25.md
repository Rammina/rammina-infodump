Good day, everyone!

I have pretty great news for today! I managed to finish my guide, [The Art of Writing Agile User Stories](https://dev.to/rammina/the-art-of-writing-agile-user-stories-17o9). The intended target readers are beginners who want to get started on writing user stories for their own projects
and/or just to learn more about Scrum. Feel free to check it out!

## Yesterday

I finished planning out my Weekly Goals and I also wrote most of the content for my user story guide.

## Today

### Scrum

I proofread, edited, and then posted my user story guide. I'm pretty content with the results for now, but it seems like there are still sections I can add and cleanup.

I hope everyone is doing well. Thank you for reading!
