Great news!

I started my first day in a new full-time role as a **_Full-stack Developer_** today. Originally, this was supposed to be a part-time position, but much to my surprise, I was told today that I'll be given a full-time role. Obviously, I was delighted to hear that, and so I accepted the offer.

It's definitely one eventful way to end the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

_Yeah, even I have a hard time letting all this sink in and accepting reality._

## Yesterday

I reviewed table relationships and the different types of JOINs for SQL tables. Also, I finish reading the Introduction to the Nexus Guide.

## Today

Without being too specific, I went through the first day of the onboarding process: being given access to the various resources, attending a few meetings, and familiarizing myself with the company I'll be joining.

## Retrospective?

I'll most likely be busy for the rest of the week with onboarding and training, so I'll try to post my thoughts about the entire challenge and share a summary of my experiences either on this weekend or on the next one. I do have things I'd like to express with regards to #100DaysOfCode, so I'll get to it when I have the time.

## Closing Remarks

I got used to blogging almost every night the past few months, so it's definitely going to feel weird not having to do this anymore. There were times that I felt like it was such a pain to write all this, but I think I'm going to miss this. It was definitely a meaningful challenge, and it was enjoyable interacting with other developers in the community.

Thank you for reading my blog posts about #100DaysOfCode, and thanks to everyone for their support!

I wish you all the best in your programming journeys.
