Hello there, everyone!

Lots of cleanup and refactoring work. I looked at my old projects from 1-2 years ago like my [online chat application](https://amussement.vercel.app/), and I saw a lot of dirty, unused code and several lines of comments that are already irrelevant. I usually get too excited when moving on to a different project and learning new technologies, so I rarely make an effort to maintain some of my older ones.

That being said, it is nice to look back and see how much I've improved over time by comparing how I coded back then and how I do now.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I finished coding and then deployed the [Terms of Use](https://www.rammina.com/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.rammina.com/privacy-policy) pages for my company site. I learned more about Next.js and SQL.

## Today

### Company Website

- I did a lot of re-factoring and cleaning up of unused code to improve performance and readability.

### Older Projects

- cleaned up a lot of dirty, unused code and comments.

### Next.js

- learned about Next.js deployment settings:
  - seems like you can turn `module.exports` in next.config.js into a function to return an object based on various conditions such as environment.
  - when deploying to Vercel, it seems like you can choose to use next.config.js or the Vercel console to set environment variables.
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- learned about different types of JOIN.
- continued to go through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- I couldn't do much related to Scrum for today.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
