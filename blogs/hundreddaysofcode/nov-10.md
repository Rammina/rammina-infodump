Greetings, everyone!

Today, I got to spend a lot of time working on my website as well as learning Next.js. I was also deciding on the layout and using other web development agencies as a reference. Either way, it was just a relatively smooth day for me.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I just reviewed some Next.js and Scrum concepts.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- I coded the hero banner skeleton layout for my homepage.
- added a temporary hero banner message (most likely will replace later).
- still contemplating on what kind of design the hero banner will have (color scheme, image, CTAs).
- I decided I would just go for a single page MVP first, with everything on the homepage and then make other pages afterwards.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

### Typescript

- I managed to squeeze in a little bit of Typescript by reading the handbook.

Have a good day, everyone!
