Happy new week, everyone!

...I don't think anyone says "happy new week" but whatever.

Today, I planned out my Weekly Sprint Goals. I intend to finish the Services pages for my [company website](https://www.rammina.com), then deploy them after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them. I also intend to continue learning Next.js, Scrum, and SWR. Lastly, I would like to learn new technologies, and I'm thinking of MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter, but I will most likely do it if I have the extra time.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

Just like I do every weekend, I did my 11th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on learning Next.js, Scrum, and SWR, updating my website, and maybe picking up another technology when I have the extra time.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Company Website

- finish building the Services pages for my [company website](https://www.rammina.com)
- deploy the updates after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them.

### Next.js

- continue learning by reading the Next.js documentation.
- continue going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
- learn SWR and go through the documentation.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.

### Learn New Skills

- If I have the extra time, I'm going to learn either MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
