Hello there, everyone!

I'd be lying to all of you if I said that this Monday was a great start to my week! It was definitely on the rough side with personal/family issues getting in the way.

However, I managed to commit to the requirements of the challenge! I finished the official Next.js tutorial and I am 3/4ths of the way through Scrum and XP from the Trenches.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I planned for what I'll be doing this week. I decided I'll be focusing on Next.js and Scrum.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- I learned about the two forms of rendering in Next.js:
  - **Static Generation** - the page HTML is generated during _build time_.
  - **Server-side Rendering** - the page HTML is generated during _each request_.
- I read about `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getServerSideProps`.
  - `getStaticProps` - fetch data at build time (static generation).
  - `getStaticPaths` - specify dynamic routes to prerender pages based on data (static generation).
  - `getServerSideProps` - fetch data on each request (server-side rendering).
- I learned how to do dynamic routing in Next.js.
- I read about how Next.js handles API support.

### Scrum

- I continued to read [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- It is best to estimate using man-days instead of hours.
- no team member has complete focus, the best realistic expectation is a focus factor of 70%.
- in most cases, it might be best to shorten the time to do manual testing, over taking a long time to establish automated tests.
- I learned a lot about Extreme Programming.

At least, I managed to get through today and still commit to my goals. I hope that I manage to make up for it on the rest of the days in this week.

Have a great Monday, everyone!
