Hello there, everyone!

I made a lot of progress with Scrum today, and I think I'm probably mostly familiar with all of the concepts I need to learn for the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification. Not much GraphQL though.

## Yesterday

I finished the draft of the Scrum Master subsection and the Scrum Artifacts of my Scrum Guide for beginners, did some practice questions for Scrum.

## Today

### Scrum

- added a `Product Backlog` section for my Scrum Guide.
- added a `Sprint Backlog` section for my Scrum Guide.
- did a lot of practice quiz questions about Scrum (spent like a few hours on them).

### GraphQL

- continued learning about GraphQL server-side.
- read more about `resolver functions`.
- learned more about the `info` argument in GraphQL resolvers.
- review concepts I've learned last week.

I wish everyone a great Thursday! Thank you for reading!
