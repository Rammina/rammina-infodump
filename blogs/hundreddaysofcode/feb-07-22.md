Happy new week, everyone!

I finally finished [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/) and [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). Both of them were great resources for learning Next.js and SQL, respectively. Now, I can finally move on to other resources.

I'm most likely going to prioritize learning how to use MySQL next. Not sure which resource to use yet, but it's what I'll be focusing on.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I learned how to use the `next-auth` package for easier handling of authentication in Next.js, practiced using different JOINs for merging SQL tables, and continued reading the Nexus Guide.

## Today

### Next.js

- learned more about managing user session using `next-auth` and how to programmatically redirect to a different URL using `useRouter` and `router.rewrite()` in Next.js.
- finished [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- learned how to use multiple self-JOINs.
- finished [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- continued reading the [Nexus guide](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2021-01/NexusGuide%202021_0.pdf?nexus-file=https%3A%2F%2Fscrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2F2021-01%2FNexusGuide%25202021_0.pdf) for scaling Scrum.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
