Happy Thanksgiving day, everyone!

...Unfortunately, we do not celebrate Thanksgiving in the country I live in, so it was just a normal day for me.

Either way, I had a great time styling my homepage. I think I can deploy a decent single-page MVP by tomorrow. There are so many things that could be improved upon, but it's not too bad and it could suffice for a business website. I most likely will move on to working on my personal blog first, before I add more pages to my company website.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

Just chilling doing some SCSS styling for my homepage. I also learned about the Scrumban method.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- mostly worked on the portfolio and contact section of the homepage.
- added an image for each portfolio project item.
- use gradient colors for the view project buttons.
- added a background image for the contact section.
- fixed element alignment and colors for the contact section.
- added contact details on the footer.
- fixed other styling all over the homepage.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day.
