Hello there, everyone!

I spent my free time today practicing aggregate functions in MySQL, such as `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, and `AVG`. `GROUP BY` took a little bit of time for me to understand, but I eventually understood how it groups together related rows.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did string functions practice in MySQL to get more used to them.

## Today

### MySQL

- I learned how to utilize the most commonly used aggregate functions in MySQL, along with `GROUP BY`.
- continued [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/).

### Scrum

- continued reading through [An Introduction to the Nexus Framework](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2016-06/An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Nexus%20Framework%20-%20June%202016_0.pdf).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
