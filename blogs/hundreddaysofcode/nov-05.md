Happy Friday, everyone!

I enjoyed learning about a lot of things today, even if it was a grind. It feels great to be productive.

Next.js is such an interesting framework to learn about! It performs really well on production and also comes with a lot of quality-of-life features built-in. I most likely will use Next.js for most of my projects from here on, because it has amazing performance and SEO benefits.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I was working on my company website, and I finished a temporary, prototype banner for it.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- I learned about the [next-seo package](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo).
- next-seo makes SEO configuration a lot easier with its built-in components:
  - `<NextSeo />` - allows you to change various meta tag values that is usually in `<Head />`
  - `<DefaultSeo />` - it enables you to set default SEO properties that affect all pages. It can be overridden by `<NextSeo />`
- kind of random, but it seems `<Container />` in Next.js is deprecated.

### Scrum

- I wrote some user stories and tasks for my company website.
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day.
