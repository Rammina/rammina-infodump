Greetings, everyone!

Today, I finished adding individual pages for my projects, such as my [chat application](https://www.rammina.com/portfolio/amussement) and [to-do-list](https://www.rammina.com/portfolio/daily-quest). While they look decent enough, they could still use some improvements. One feature I would like to implement at some point is an image carousel, as that would look much more professional than just lining up images vertically.

I also started working on individual services pages for Web Development, Digital Marketing, and Writing. Currently, I am not sure what content I will put inside these pages and how to lay everything out that would convert a visitor to a customer. It might take me some time to come up with a final design.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

- I finished the mobile and desktop designs for my specific portfolio project page component.
- I read an article about Scrum, specifically, an example of a great facilitator and coach.
- also watched a video from Ahrefs about Domain Authority.

## Today

### Company Website

- finished creating project detail pages for my chat application and to-do-list app.
- add boilerplate for individual services pages (WIP).

### Scrum

- read this Scrum article, [Typical Sprint: Play-by-play | Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/typical-sprint-play-play).
- it's not really anything groundbreaking, and the stuff I've read were already in the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html), but I appreciate the extra examples.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
