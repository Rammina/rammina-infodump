Happy weekend, everyone!

I've done a lot of SQL learning today, and I'm almost done with [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial). Afterwards, I should be ready to move to MySQL, as I now have a decent grasp of SQL basics.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I fixed some styling bugs that I overlooked for a while, and continued to learn more about Next.js, SQL, and scaled Scrum.

## Today

### Next.js

- learned about server-side authentication and access token authentication (JWTs) in Next.js.
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- learned about inner and outer JOINs.
- learned about chaining multiple JOINs to merge multiple tables.
- continued to go through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- continued reading the [Nexus guide](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2021-01/NexusGuide%202021_0.pdf?nexus-file=https%3A%2F%2Fscrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2F2021-01%2FNexusGuide%25202021_0.pdf) for scaling Scrum.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
