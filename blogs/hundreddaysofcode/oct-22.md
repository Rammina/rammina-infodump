Happy Friday, everyone!

Today, I took a break from coding and learning Scrum. I simply did 2 hours of learning for the challenge. After all, I can't always be working nonstop and I also wanted to spend time with my family. I do care about my work-life balance and I don't like neglecting my loved ones.

## Yesterday

I finished the draft of the `Product Backlog` and `Sprint Backlog` section and did some practice questions for Scrum.

## Today

Here are the things I've learned and done today:

### Scrum

- did practice quiz questions about Scrum.
- took a break from writing the guide.

### GraphQL

- I learned about Build-time Schema Validation & Optimizations in GraphQL.
- GraphQL apparently lets you have UI code and data requirements side-by-side.
- GraphQL server lets you send batched requests and batched resolvers.

Have a great Friday and weekend everyone! Thank you for reading!
