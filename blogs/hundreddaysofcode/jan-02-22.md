Good day, everyone!

Today was a great start to this year for me, in terms of productivity. I've had a lot of fun working on my [business site](https://www.rammina.com), studying Scrum, and fixing my Ghost CMS. I fixed all of the broken links on my website, added an [affiliates page](https://www.rammina.com/affiliates) for those who would like to exchange backlinks, and updated my projects to have a link to their respective Github repositories.

And I also discovered this bug on my error 404 page, which I have embarrassingly overlooked the past few weeks:

One unfortunate thing that happened to me today was that Scrum.org kept on rejecting my transactions, despite already using 3 different credit cards and PayPal. I have contacted their support email, but it kind of feels annoying to be held from buying their Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam when I'm already prepared to take it.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I found some bugs to fix in my website, studied Scrum by reading the guide and taking practice tests, and dealt with my huge backlog of emails, messages, and notifications. A slow, but smooth start to a new year.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- I added an affiliates page on my [company website](https://www.rammina.com).
- fixed a bug in which there was a duplicate footer on the error 404 page.
- replaced broken links on the footer with functional ones.
- attached a link to the respective Github repository of each project.
- fixed my Ghost CMS (had to replace it and redeploy because I went over the free plan).

### Scrum

- I reread the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).
- Took some practice exams for the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

It was also nice to see some familiar people again, after a few weeks.Have a good day, everyone!
