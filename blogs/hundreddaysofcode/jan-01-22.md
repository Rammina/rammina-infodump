Happy New Year, everyone!

I took a long time off from coding and blogging during the holiday season. My [previous post](https://blog.rammina.com/day-66-of-100-days-of-code-and-scrum-services-and-portfolio-pages-for-my-business-website) was back from December 21, 2021. I just wanted to take a break from my usual daily routine and spend time with people that I cared for the most.

Today, I finally went back into it! I have a long list of tasks that I have to deal with as a result of taking a break for about two weeks. I managed to deal with my social media backlog, which I haven't checked in a while. Also, I checked my e-mails and other messages.

In my remaining free time, I studied Scrum for my upcoming Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam. Also, I re-examined my [company website](https://www.rammina.com), found some of the things that didn't work as intended, as well as thought of ways to improve the [Portfolio](https://www.rammina.com/portfolio) and [Services](https://www.rammina.com/services) sections of the website. It was kind of difficult to start working after such a long break, but it shouldn't take me long to get back my lost momentum.

Anyway, let's move on to my first daily report of the year!

## Two Week Holiday Break

No coding, blogging, and social media. Time was spent with my wife playing games, reading novels, eating unhealthy Christmas food, watching movies, and unproductive things.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- I found a few things that are either bugs or not working as intended in my [business website](https://www.rammina.com).
- plan out how to improve the [Portfolio](https://www.rammina.com/portfolio) and [Services](https://www.rammina.com/services) sections of the website.

### Scrum

- I reread the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).
- Took some practice exams for the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

### Other Stuff

- replied to emails and social media messages.

I hope everyone had a great time during the holidays. And I wish you all the best for this new year!
