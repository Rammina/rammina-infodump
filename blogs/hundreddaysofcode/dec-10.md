Greetings, everyone!

Today, I made some progress on the styling of [the Rammina coding blog](https://www.rammina.com/)'s **Recent Posts** section. There are still a lot of things to improve on, but I am liking where the design is heading towards. It was fun to work on!

I most likely will deploy it tomorrow or the next day.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I got a prototype design done for a specific blog page.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Blog

- styled my [company page blog](https://www.rammina.com/) **Recent Posts** section.
- learned about various data objects in the Ghost Content API, such as `posts`, `pages`, and `authors`.
- practiced Typescript non-null assertion `!` and the `as <type>` keyword.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I hope everyone's doing well.
