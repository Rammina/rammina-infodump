Happy Friday, everyone!

Today was a grind, but I learned a lot. Firstly, I read [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/) for an hour or so. After that, I worked out because sitting down and staring at the screen for too long can be draining. I spent the rest of the day learning and reviewing Next.js.

An interesting fact I didn't know before was that Next.js implements lazy loading for images, so images are loaded only as you scroll down to them. This is very efficient for websites!

Anyway, moving on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I found a really fun resource for Scrum, which was a Scrum Comic. Also, I learned about misconceptions revolving around the Product Owner role and how large businesses fail to implement scrum properly.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Scrum

- I read [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- I learned a lot about Product Backlog management.
- Product Backlog Items (and User Stories) ideally should have:
  - `ID` - unique identifier to keep track of an item in case it is renamed
  - `Name` - a short descriptive name.
  - `Importance` - a Product Owner's importance rating.
  - `Initial Estimate` - the Development Team's initial estimate about how much work is needed to implement this story. T-shirt sizes are great ways to estimate.
  - `How to Demo` - high-level description of how it will be demonstrated in the Sprint Demo.
  - `Notes` - brief info or clarification
- learned about the differences between external and internal quality
- while it is tempting to immediately create a visible output that the clients would appreciate (external quality), internal quality is more important and is nonnegotiable (cannot be compromised).

### Next.js

- I followed the [official Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=nav-cta&utm_campaign=next-website) to review Next.js.
- learned about lazy loading for images in Next.js
- reviewed the difference in Routing between vanilla React and Next.js.
- reviewed `css-modules` and its syntax
- reviewed about `<Head>` and `<Layout>`

_phew_ That's a lot of learning!

Have a great Friday, everyone!
