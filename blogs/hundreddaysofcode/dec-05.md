Happy Sunday, everyone!

My main objective for this week is to get my professional blog up and running. I intend to use a combination of Next.js frontend deployed on Vercel and Ghost headless CMS deployed on Heroku. If possible, I would like to deploy two applications (main site and blog) in separate repositories, but on the same domain.

## Yesterday

Just like I do every weekend, I did my 8th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on my **professional blog**.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- code my blog's Next.js frontend.
- setup Ghost headless CMS.
- have the frontend communicate with Ghost Content API.
- fix the bugs in my company website.
- continue to learn Next.js and Typescript by using concepts while I build my blog or maybe just from reading documentations.
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- continue networking.

Have a great week, everyone!
