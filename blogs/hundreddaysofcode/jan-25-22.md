Good day, everyone!

...I took a 3-day break from blogging, so this post is kind of late.

I think I pretty much achieved what I sought out to do this week, aside from learning SWR which I forgot. In terms of progress, I think I've done plenty:

- I deployed a functional update of the Services pages of my [business website](https://www.rammina.com).
- I finished 3 chapters of [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
- read through multiple Scrum articles.
- learned plenty about SQL and MySQL.

Anyway, let's move on to my weekly retrospective!

## Weekly Sprint Goals

### Company Website

- finish building the Services pages for my [company website](https://www.rammina.com)
- deploy the updates after fixing any bugs and cleaning up the styling for them.

### Next.js

- continue learning by reading the Next.js documentation.
- continue going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
- learn SWR and go through the documentation.

### Scrum

- continue to learn more about Scrum, through reading articles and watching videos.

### Learn New Skills

- If I have the extra time, I'm going to learn either MySQL/postgreSQL or Flutter.

## Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

- finished building and deploying the services pages for my [business site](https://www.rammina.com).
- I learned more about Next.js and Scrum.
- adopted new skills as a developer.

### Some Mistakes I've Made

- I forgot to continue reading SWR documentation.
- I wasn't managing my time efficiently.
- I don't have a set structure and schedule for doing things, so I tend to forget to do some things eventually.
- I'm terrible at dealing with interruptions to my usual routine.

### Things I Could Improve On

- accept that there will always be things that interrupt me, and I should just continue whenever I can, instead of letting it put me down for the rest of the day.
- try to do things at the same time and setting if possible to avoid procrastination.
- limit distractions especially when I'm in the middle of work.

### Resources/Recommended Readings
