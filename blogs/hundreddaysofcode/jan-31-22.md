Happy new week, everyone!

I'm back to coding again after taking a break for three days because of COVID-19 vaccine booster side effects. I think I did fairly plenty considering I just recently recovered. Not a bad way to start the week, I'd say.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## The Past 3 Days

I didn't really get to code as I was resting while being sick.

## Today

### Next.js

- utilized `react-markdown` npm package to render markdown as JSX safely (gives protection to cross-site-scripting/XSS, unlike `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- more practice with nested SELECTs, correlated subqueries and aggregate functions, such as SUM and COUNT.
- continued to go through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- I couldn't do much related to Scrum for today.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
