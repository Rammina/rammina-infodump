Hello there, everyone!

Today was my weekly visit to my physical therapist, so I couldn't do much coding.

I built around half of the content for the Writing Services section for my [business site](https://www.rammina.com). It should be ready for deployment by tomorrow or the next day. Also, I learned a little bit more Next.js.

I decided to pick up MySQL because I'm going to need it soon. I've been relying too much on MongoDB, which is a noSQL database.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I set my goals for this week, which are:

- finishing the Services pages and then deploying them.
- learning more Next.js and Scrum.
- pick up either MySQL or Flutter, and I decided to go for the former.

## Today

### Company Website

- coded around half of the content for the Writing Services section.

### Next.js

- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).
- learn a little bit more SWR.

### Scrum

- I didn't have the time to read an article about Scrum for today.

### MySQL

- I learned some basic concepts in MySQL.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
