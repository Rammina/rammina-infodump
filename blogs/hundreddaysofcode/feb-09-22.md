Greetings, everyone!

I've spent most of the day learning MySQL, mostly focusing on CRUD operations. I'm starting to get used to MySQL now, and while I still prefer to use NoSQL databases for their flexibility, SQL can be fairly enjoyable to use as well.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

- I started [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/) and learned how to create, describe, and delete databases and tables in MySQL.

## Today

### MySQL

- learned how to perform CRUD operations in MySQL, using `CREATE`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- continued [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/).

### Scrum

- continued reading through [An Introduction to the Nexus Framework](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2016-06/An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Nexus%20Framework%20-%20June%202016_0.pdf).

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
