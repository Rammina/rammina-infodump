Happy Sunday, everyone!

I decided that I will focus on my website primarily for this week. I must create an output that I can deploy and show at the end of the week. I'm giving myself a deadline so that I'm forced to work the best that I can.

## Yesterday

Just like I do every weekend, I did my 6th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will mostly basic concern my **company website's homepage**. The others are secondary goals, which I will work on for a little bit each day without compromising my main objective.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- finish my company website's homepage (and avoid getting distracted by more interesting projects).
- continue to learn Next.js and Typescript by using concepts while I build my website.
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).

Have a great week, everyone!
