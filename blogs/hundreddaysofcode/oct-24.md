Happy Sunday, everyone!

I kickstarted my week by getting my new user story article finished. I'm going to do proofreading on it tomorrow, as I'm way too sleepy now. Also, I worked on creating my banner with my editor. I'm going for a milk tea color palette/theme, it's still a work in progress.

## Yesterday

I did my Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future. It most likely was my worst week so far.

## Today

Since it's the start of a new week, I planned out what I should be doing and established my new `Sprint Goals`. My focus for this week will still be **Scrum**, to prepare for my PSM I exam and the upcoming [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) voyage.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- focus on diving deeper into **Scrum** principles
- study for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification
- finish my guides about Scrum
- continue networking
- if I have extra time, learn about Next.js to prepare for coding my business website
- no interviews

Thank you to everyone who supported me and interacted with me during the past weeks! I hope we can make a lot of progress this week.

I hope everyone's enjoying their weekend!
