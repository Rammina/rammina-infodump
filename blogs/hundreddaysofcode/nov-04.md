Good day, everyone!

I'm doing a lot better now compared to yesterday. Thank you for the kind concern and support!

I decided to take it easier today compared to usual. However, I managed to get a lot done and I do have something to show. I've finally made a temporary, prototype design template for my company.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday
