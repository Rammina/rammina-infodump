Guess what, everyone?!

I've already been blogging daily for a month now! It's my 4th Weekly Retrospective, and I didn't even notice I already got this far. It definitely has been a rough, yet fulfilling journey!

Thank you to everyone who have followed me so far! A lot of you have encouraged me to keep going through this challenge.

Special thanks to my wife and editor, May for editing images, sharing ideas for content, and supporting my career and decisions.

Anyway, I'm not going to skip my retrospective, so let's move on to my daily report!

## Weekly Sprint Goals

For reference, here were the Sprint Goals for this week:

- learn and review Next.js.
- lay out my plans for my company's website.
- write user stories for my website, so I can plan ahead and prioritize what features I will really need right away and what might be desirable in the future.
- finish my beginner Scrum guide.
- finish reading [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- finish my guides about Scrum.
- continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).

...I think I did everything _except finishing my beginner Scrum guide_!

## Weekly Review

I was really close to achieving all of my weekly goals! Here are what I've done:

- finish the official Next.js tutorial.
- finish reading [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- make initial plans for my company's website.
- write user stories for my website.
- created a temporary, prototype company banner.
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- continue to network, but this time I did not spend as much time on social media!

## Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

- finish the official Next.js tutorial.
- finish reading [Scrum and XP from the Trenches](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches-2/).
- created a temporary, prototype company banner.
- started working on my company's website, built with Next.js.
- reached out to multiple people on different platforms, but without getting too distracted by social media.

### Some Mistakes I've Made

- I couldn't finish my _Introduction to Scrum_ guide.
- I don't know why I keep forgetting to make the guide.
- AGAIN, forgot to install a website blocker to stop myself from checking off-topic content (subconsciously, I could be avoiding this).

### Things I Could Improve On

- stop procrastinating writing the Scrum guide.
- I should DEFINITELY install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.
- prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.

I'm rejoicing over the fact that I've been keeping this up for a month now.

Thank you once again, everyone! Have a great weekend!
