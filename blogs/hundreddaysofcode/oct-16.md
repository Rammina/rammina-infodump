Happy weekend, everyone!

Today marks the end of the week, and so I will be doing a Sprint Review and Retrospective as I said I would [at the beginning of this challenge](https://dev.to/rammina/100-days-of-code-and-scrum-a-new-challenge-24lp).

## My Previous Weekly Sprint Goals

For reference, here were the Sprint Goals for this week:

- prepare for and go through 5 phone screening/interviews at different companies
- learn to use `GraphQL` and `ApolloClient`
  - would be happy if I learned how to query data to the client side
  - mutate data
  - learning more is always okay
- get through the howtographql tutorials
- study `GraphQL` documentation along the way

How much of these have I accomplished?

## Weekly Review

I believe I've met most of my Sprint Goals for this week, but it honestly could have been better.

In any case, here were the things I've done:

- go through 3 phone screening/interviews at different companies (2 of them I just withdrew)
- I learned to use frontend `GraphQL` and `ApolloClient`
- I can somehow utilize:
  - `ApolloClient` to initialize an ApolloClient object which will be used by React components via the Context API
  - `createHttpLink` to create the HTTP link that connects the Apollo client with the GraphQL API
  - `useQuery` and `useLazyQuery` for retrieving data from the server
  - `useMutation` to alter the data in the server-side
  - GraphQL `subscriptions` for listening to listen to events via `WebSocketLink`
  - interacting with the `ApolloClient` cache using `readQuery` and `writeQuery`
- I read through [The Scrum Guide 2020](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) twice this week I think I'm very much familiar with all of the concepts.
- I've done some extra learning what each role in the Scrum Team would do in a real world setting.

## Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

- I met my learning goals for `GraphQL` and `ApolloClient`, and even went for more.
- Got through some interviews, and I got to the last phase for one of them.
- I'm a lot more familiar with Scrum and can recall a lot of concepts.

### Some Mistakes I've Made

- applying to too many companies.
- scheduling too many interviews, which made me decline some of them.
- fatigued myself too much from dealing with too many things (code, scrumstudy, blog, social media, emails).
- checking notifications too much and distracting myself from focusing on one thing at a time.
- failing to distribute and prioritize which tasks are more important.

### Things I Could Improve On

- most likely check emails, social media, and blog on a set schedule instead.
- I should probably install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.
- prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.
- try to make additional changes to whatever tutorial I'm following to help enforce learning.

## First Week is Finally Over!

I'm glad that I managed to get through this first week and commit to most of my goals this week.

However, I will admit that this is pretty brutal, because I'm forced to work on concrete goals rather than just learning aimlessly. It was definitely draining, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of this. I'm hoping to apply the things I've learned from here on.

Thank you to everyone who followed me and interacted with me during the past week!

Good luck on your developer journeys, and I wish you the best. Have a great weekend, everyone!
