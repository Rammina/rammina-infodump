Hello there!

Like every Tuesday, wasn't that productive today because I was impeded by my Physical Therapy session.

I didn't have much time for coding, and the best that I could do where make a desktop breakpoint for my navbar, re-factor my code, and then do a pull request to merge it with my main branch. Next, I have to make a Services section, so I was looking at the websites of web agencies to use as a reference for design. I did not start coding it yet, but I already made another branch for it.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I learned about `react-css-modules` and used it to make it easier to code CSS. Also, I finished the mobile version of my navigation menu.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- remembered to use `<Image />` for images in Next.js as it comes with optimization such as lazy loading.
- I also learned that if you want to style `<Link />` with a className, you can insert `<a className={styles.link}>link text</a>` like this:

```
<Link href="/">
  <a className={styles.link}>Home</a>
</Link>
```

- and that you can't do it like this (INVALID):

```
<Link href="/" className={styles.link}>Home</Link>
```

### Scrum

- read some horror stories about Scrumbags (really bad Scrum Masters).
- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

I want to make some time for studying Typescript, but maybe tomorrow onwards.

Have a good day, everyone!
