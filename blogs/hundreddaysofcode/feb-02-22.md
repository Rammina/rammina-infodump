Good day, everyone!

Today was a fairly productive day, I've done multiple things such as coding and deploying the [Terms of Use](https://www.rammina.com/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.rammina.com/privacy-policy) pages for my business site, learned how to use JOIN in SQL, and learned about Next.js' various deployment settings.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I learned about using `react-markdown` npm package to render markdown as JSX safely and `graymatter` to add metadata to markdown files.

## Today

### Company Website

- I coded and deployed the [Terms of Use](https://www.rammina.com/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.rammina.com/privacy-policy) pages for my company site.
- got rid of a styling bug in the Footer links.

### Next.js

- learned about various deployment settings:
  - how to use the `next.config.js` file.
  - the difference between `next build` (standard build which includes Node.js server) and `next export` (full static build that only has pre-generated HTML/CSS/JS).
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- learned how to use JOIN to merge two different tables' contents.
- continued to go through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- I couldn't do much related to Scrum for today.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
