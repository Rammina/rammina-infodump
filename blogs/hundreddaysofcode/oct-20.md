Good day, everyone!

Today was actually a productive day for me. I managed to study a lot of Scrum and GraphQL, continued to work on writing my Scrum article, and reached out to multiple people to expand my network. Oh, and I also made my own [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/RamminaR), which I didn't customize yet.

## Yesterday

I finished the draft of the Scrum Team section of my Scrum Guide for beginners, and I also reviewed GraphQL's basic concepts.

## Today

### Scrum

- added Scrum Master subsection for my Scrum Guide.
- added Scrum Artifacts section.
- did some practice quiz questions about Scrum.

### GraphQL

- started learning about GraphQL server-side.
- read about GraphQL `schemas`, `type definitions`, and `resolver functions`.
- learned about GraphQL server's network layer.
- read an introduction to GraphQL server libraries such as `express-graphql`, `apollo-server`, and `graphql-yoga`.
- look deeper into how GraphQL differs from REST API, and which scenarios one should be used over the other.
- review concepts I've learned last week.

I hope everyone's doing great! Thank you for reading!
