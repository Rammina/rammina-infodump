Good day, everyone!

Today was rather stressful, but I still managed to get my minimum required work done, along with some side Photoshop work.

## Panel Interview

Firstly, I had to go through a panel interview, which I find anxiety-inducing for an introvert like me.

I don't really understand why businesses feel the need to have 5 people interview someone, each of them crossing their arms and taking turns to ask questions. In some places I've interviewed with, they invite someone that's not really relevant and doesn't even talk. I just think it's inefficient, but that's just my opinion anyway.

I believe I did well in the interview (I think the wait drained me more than the interview itself), but I should've asked more questions to show interest in the job position or in the company. Not asking questions is a yellow flag that shows that a candidate is kind of apathetic with regard to the company and job position.

## Dating Site Ad?

I was practicing Photoshop on the side as well. Specifically, I tried to make a poster for [Chingu.io](https://chingu.io/) for promoting the weekly pair programming matchups that they offer.

### The result?

It looks like a dating site ad, and I kind of cringed inside, to be honest. Maybe I will update it some more, but I could also just use this because it looks pretty nice anyway and the meme value might give it more attention.

## Yesterday

I learned about `useLazyQuery`, GraphQL `subscriptions`, and `WebSocketLink`. I also managed to finish the React + Apollo client tutorial at https://www.howtographql.com/.

## Today

Here are some of the things I've learned/reviewed:

### GraphQL

I'm reviewing everything I learned about GraphQL this week, especially the gaps in my knowledge. I'm also learning more about use cases and comparisons of REST and GraphQL.

### Scrum

The Scrum Master assists the Development Team in the following ways:

- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality.
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products.
- Removing impediments to the Development Teamâ€™s progress.
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
