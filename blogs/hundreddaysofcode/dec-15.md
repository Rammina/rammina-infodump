Good day, everyone!

I spent most of my day working on the [company website](https://www.rammina.com)'s `<meta>` tags using **OpenGraph** attributes, as well as the Twitter counterparts. I utilized the `next-seo` package to make it simpler to manage each page's `<meta>` tags. Most of the challenge was making dynamic blog data display the appropriate card summary. At one point, I made a mistake deploying erroneous code the production, which took a while to display the correct values (embarrassing because other people could see it).

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I worked on static `<meta>` tags for my [web development page](https://www.rammina.com). Not much work done, because it was also my physical therapy visit that day.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- continued learning **OpenGraph** and the Twitter equivalent.
- used `next-seo` package to manage `<meta>` dynamically for blog posts retrieved from Ghost.
- preview images are now dynamic for each page.
- put temporary placeholder sections for **Services** and **Portfolio** pages to remove broken links.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I wish you the best.
