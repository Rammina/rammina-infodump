My main Internet connection was dead today. That really killed my productivity.

This blog post was sent using 4G mobile data. Thankfully, I have some offline resources like flashcards and e-books, so I could still somehow study a little bit.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report...

## Yesterday

I worked on my hero banner for my website, and did some Scrum flashcards.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- RIP.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

### Typescript

- I read whatever was on my offline cache...

I hope you all have Internet, because mine is dead.

Have a good day, everyone!
