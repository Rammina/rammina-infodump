Happy Sunday, everyone!

This week I will be focusing on fixing any remaining bugs and deploying my company website, as well as working on my personal blog. I most likely will work on them in that order, because I don't want to get distracted and leave anything unfinished. I think imposing a deadline on myself helped me be more productive last week, so I will most likely do that again.

## Yesterday

Just like I do every weekend, I did my 7th Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

I set up my weekly Sprint Goals, which will focus on my **company website and personal blog**.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- fix the bugs in my company website.
- deploy my company website after cleaning everything up.
- after the website, learn Ghost so I can use it to build my personal blog.
- continue to learn Next.js and Typescript by using concepts while I build my website or maybe just from reading documentations.
- continue studying for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification.
- continue networking, but allocate less time to this (coding is more important).

Have a great week, everyone!
