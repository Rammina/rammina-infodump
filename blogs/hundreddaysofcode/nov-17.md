Greetings, everyone!

Today, I got sick so I wasn't really that productive. I didn't get much sleep because I woke up in the middle of the night with dizziness. Oh well, I still managed to get some work done for my website. I only coded the minimum required, which was an hour.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I worked on my portfolio and services sections, and I dealt with Next.js `<Image />` shenanigans.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- worked on the styling of my portfolio section for the homepage.
- preliminary skeleton is there, so I will most likely move on to the Contact form's frontend and styling.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Not much done this time, I'll try better tomorrow.

Thank you for reading, and I hope everyone is doing well!
