Good day, everyone!

It's Monday again... the start of a new week. I have to admit, this has become pretty normal for me now that it's been a month.

Speaking of which, I will be writing about my experiences in my first month of blogging. I might go for a more realistic depiction of what beginner bloggers experience, instead of the typical click bait articles about starting a blog. With all the things I'm new juggling right now, I might publish it around the end of the week, we'll see.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did my Sprint Planning yesterday, and I said I'll be focusing on **Next.js** and **Typescript**, while still studying **Scrum**.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- I learned about and used `react-css-modules` to make modular CSS a lot easier to utilize.
- I finished the mobile version of the navbar skeleton.
- working on my company website.
- I decided on what things I'll be working on for my company website. Here are some of them:

I'm using [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/) as my task/project management tool.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Once again, thank you to everyone for reading and supporting me! I wish you all the best!
