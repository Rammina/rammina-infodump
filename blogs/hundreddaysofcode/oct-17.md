Good Sunday, everyone!

I took a healthy break for the day, while still meeting the requirements of the challenge.

## Yesterday

I did my Weekly Sprint Review and Retrospective, in which I went over what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings were, and what I could do better in the future.

## Today

Since it's the start of a new week, I planned out what I should be doing and established my new `Sprint Goals`. My focus for this week will be **Scrum**, to prepare for the upcoming [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) voyage.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- focus on learning **Scrum** principles
- study for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification
- write some guides about Scrum
- continue learning GraphQL
- continue networking
- no interviews for now
