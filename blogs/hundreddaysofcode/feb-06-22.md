Hello there, everyone!

I took an easy day with coding since it's Sunday. However, still made sure to code a little bit and learn some Next.js.

That said, I'm almost done with [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/). I'd say it was a great introductory resource to Next.js. One could learn a lot from it paired with the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I learned about authentication in Next.js, JOINing tables in SQL, and continued reading the Nexus Guide.

## Today

### Next.js

- learned how to use the `next-auth` package for easier handling of authentication in Next.js.
- practiced using `next-auth`'s client-side methods/hooks such as `signIn`, `signOut`, `useSession`, and `getSession`.
- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### SQL

- practice using different JOINs of for emerging SQL tables.
- continued to go through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).

### Scrum

- continued reading the [Nexus guide](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2021-01/NexusGuide%202021_0.pdf?nexus-file=https%3A%2F%2Fscrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2F2021-01%2FNexusGuide%25202021_0.pdf) for scaling Scrum.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
