Hello there, everyone!

Like every Tuesday, I had to go to my physical therapy session, so I could not code as much.

However, I still made some progress with my [company website](https://www.rammina.com)'s `<meta>` tags. I learned about **OpenGraph**, which is essential for improving page SEO. Another thing I used was the `next-seo` package to make it a lot easier to manage `<meta>` on a page-by-page basis. I highly recommend anyone using Next.js to utilize that library, as it gives a lot of quality of life improvements.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I deployed and fixed production bugs on my [web development blog](https://www.rammina.com/blog). I also enhanced some styling, and I was fairly pleased with everything so far.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Company Website

- learned about **OpenGraph** and the Twitter equivalent.
- used `next-seo` package to manage `<meta>`.
- added different preview images for different parts of the website.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading! I wish you the best.
