Good morning, everyone!

Today was a rather productive day!

I got a lot of networking done for various services, I met both of my GraphQL coding and Scrum studying goals, and I managed to work on my company logo.

I'm starting to get a better hang of balancing coding, studying, and networking. I checked my emails less, and I don't feel as for us to check all notifications on social media. Focusing on one thing at a time is just crucial for productivity.

## Yesterday

I learned about `setContext` and `ApolloClient`'s caching methods such as `readQuery` and `writeQuery`.

## Today

Here are some of the things I've learned:

### GraphQL

- `useLazyQuery` is a version of `useQuery` that needs to be manually executed for it to retrieve data from the server
- `useQuery`, on the other hand, runs automatically when the component mounts
- GraphQL `subscriptions` allows the server to automatically send data to the client side when triggered by a specific event
- with GraphQL `subscriptions`, the client and server have a steady connection instead of following a typical request-and-response cycle
- GraphQL `subscriptions` use `WebSocketLink` which uses a WebSocket connection instead of HTTP (which queries and mutations use).

I managed to finish the React + Apollo client tutorial at https://www.howtographql.com/. It was a pretty useful resource and tutorial.

However, I still think I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge and I can't reliably use the hooks, functions and other concepts yet. I should probably build the project on my own that uses GraphQL, which is most likely going to help me cement my knowledge.

### Scrum

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

- Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.
- Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
- Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

How is everyone doing in their learning journey? Feel free to chat with me in the comments and/via DM!
