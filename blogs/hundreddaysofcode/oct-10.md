## Yesterday

I learned the basic structure of GraphQL types, fields, payload, and so on.

## Today

Nothing too crazy because it is a break day. I studied a little bit and planned out what my goals are for this week.

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- prepare for and go through 5 phone screening/interviews at different companies
- learn to use GraphQL and ApolloClient
  - would be happy if I learned how to query data to the client side
  - mutate data
  - learning more is always okay
- get through the howtographql tutorials
- study GraphQL documentation along the way

I mostly focused on learning about GraphQL and ApolloClient imports/initialization.

Here are some of the things I've learned:

### GraphQL

- concept of a GraphQL client, which abstracts away the details of writing infrastructure code and caching from developers
- ApolloClient, Relay, and urql are GraphQL clients
- ApolloProvider, ApolloClient, createHttpLink, InMemoryCache typically are imported when using @apollo/client
- I am still not really sure what they do but I'm going to look them up tomorrow

### Scrum

- Scrum Master role typically has no management power
- Scrum Masters facilitate the Scrum team so that they follow Scrum principles
- They have to do this without any authority
- I guess if I want to be Scrum Master, I'd have to learn how to influence others without using authority/power
- Daily Scrum lasts 15 minutes regardless of the team size

I'm still having a difficulty with getting used to working with the new syntax for GraphQL/ApolloClient.

How is everyone doing in their learning journey? Feel free to chat with me in the comments and/via DM!
