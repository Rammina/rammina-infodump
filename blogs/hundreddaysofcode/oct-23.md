Happy weekend, everyone!

Today marks the end of the second week, and so I will be doing a Sprint Review and Retrospective as I mentioned back then, [at the beginning of this challenge](https://dev.to/rammina/100-days-of-code-and-scrum-a-new-challenge-24lp).

## My Previous Weekly Sprint Goals

For reference, here were the Sprint Goals for this week:

## Weekly Sprint Goals

- focus on learning **Scrum** principles
- study for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification
- write some guides about Scrum
- continue learning GraphQL
- continue networking
- no interviews for this week

**gulp** How much of these have I accomplished?

## Weekly Review

I think I finished around 80% of my Sprint Goals for this week, but I didn't really finish any guide that I planned to write...

In any case, here were the things I've done:

- I have reread [The 2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) multiple times while trying to write guides for Scrum.
- write an incomplete draft for _Introduction to Scrum_, which covers Scrum as a framework, the Scrum Team and its members, and Scrum Artifacts such as the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Increment.
- worked on completely revamping my _User Story Guide_, because the first one really sucks and was just a short post.
- used [Anki flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to study for the PSM I certification exam.
- studied server-side GraphQL and reviewed some of the things I've learned last week.
- I definitely networked a lot on multiple platforms.
- I made a new [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/RamminaR).

## Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let's tackle what I've managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

- met my learning goals for **Scrum**.
- managed to continue learning about GraphQL, and not forgetting the things I've learned from last week.
- I was able to work towards writing the guide articles.
- reached out to multiple people on different platforms.
- not part of my weekly goals, but I learned a lot about SEO.

### Some Mistakes I've Made

- I'm just bad at managing my time, I check social media too much.
- forgot to install a website blocker to stop myself from checking off-topic content.

### Things I Could Improve On

- most likely check emails, social media, and blog on a set schedule instead.
- I should definitely install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.
- prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.

## Got Through the Second Week

The second week was definitely a lot more stressful than the first one, mostly because of personal life issues happening.

However, I managed to commit to my goals and make progress because of the rules of the challenge. I may not have achieved everything that I intended to on this week, but I'm at least partially done with them. I do recommend everyone to try doing the 100 Days of Code challenge, it's really fulfilling and helpful.

Thank you to everyone who supported me and interacted with me during the past weeks!

Good luck on your developer journeys, and I wish you the best. Have a great weekend, everyone!
