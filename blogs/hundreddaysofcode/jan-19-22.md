Good day, everyone!

Today was a productive day for me. I've managed to do multiple things, from finishing the content of my Writing Services page, learning more Next.js, practicing for interviews, as well as learning MySQL.

As I was learning MySQL, I decided that it would be more beneficial for me to learn SQL basic concepts first, before I work with a bigger tool like MySQL. I am going to focus on working through [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) first to get a solid grasp of the principles. It's a pretty solid resource so far with easy to understand examples.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did various things, such as working on my [company website](https://www.rammina.com), learning Next.js, and picking up MySQL.

## Today

### Company Website

- finished the content for the Writing Services section.
- improved the structure of the footer (added boundary lines for different subsections).
- working on adding Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pages.

### Next.js

- continued going through [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

### Scrum

- I didn't have the time to read an article about Scrum for today.

### SQL & MySQL

- I installed MySQL and played with a few things like SELECT, WHERE, FROM, and IN.

Thank you for reading! Have a good day!
