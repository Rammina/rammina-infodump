Greetings, everyone!

Today, I fixed some styling bugs on the portfolio section of my [business site](https://www.rammina.com). It's kind of funny that I didn't catch this for a month, because it was at a very narrow breakpoint range (around a width of 768px - 1024px) that I just overlooked. Oh well, at least it's fixed now, and I also made some styling improvements for the blog section and then added it to the homepage as well.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I did a lot of code cleaning and refactoring, plus I also learned more Next.js and SQL.
