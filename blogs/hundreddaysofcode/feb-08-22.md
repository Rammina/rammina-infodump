Good day, everyone!

Today, I started learning MySQL and picked up some of the basics. I think I made the right choice being familiar with SQL first, as most of the SQL database management systems (such as MySQL, postgreSQL, and SQLite) use almost the same commands with a few differences between of them. As for the resource I'm using, I chose [Colt Steele's MySQL course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/) which is pretty fun and beginner-friendly.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

- I finished these two courses: [Next.js & React by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/) and [SQLZoo's SQL Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).
- also finished reading the [Nexus guide](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/2021-01/NexusGuide%202021_0.pdf?nexus-file=https%3A%2F%2Fscrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2F2021-01%2FNexusGuide%25202021_0.pdf) for scaling Scrum.
