Good day, everyone!

I'm feeling a lot better today than yesterday, so I managed to get more things done this time. I spent most of my time working on the contact form for my company website. Most of the functional frontend aspects of it are nearly complete, I just need to have it communicate with the AWS serverless backend. After that comes styling the contact form.

Anyway, let's move on to my daily report!

## Yesterday

I didn't have much time to work yesterday from feeling sick. I finished the styling of the portfolio section's skeleton layout.

## Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Next.js

- finished most of the HTML of the contact form.
- added state management of each input field using React `useState` hooks.
- put form validation methods and state changes for the required fields on change, blur, and submit events.
- display error messages as needed.

### Scrum

- I did some practice flashcards for Scrum.
- reviewed some of the things I've learned before.

Thank you for reading, and I wish everyone the best!
