Good morning, everyone!

It's Monday again, the day that a lot of people dread so much. But it's also the best chance to kickstart our productivity for the week!

## Yesterday

I established my `Sprint Goals` for the week, and it focuses on **Scrum**.

## Today

### Scrum

- I was working on writing the introductory Scrum guide that I'm planning to publish before the end of this month.
- also was studying more about the principles of Scrum, where it is best applied, and where it shouldn't be.
- read up more into how Scrum should be utilized and how many businesses make mistakes when applying the framework.
- looked into how the members of a Scrum Team function individually as well as their interactions with the others.

### GraphQL

- review concepts I've learned last week.
- look deeper into how GraphQL differs from REST API, and which scenarios one should be used over the other.

### Resources/Recommended Readings
