Hello there, everyone!

I just wanted to ask you all, how do you stay productive as a developer?

Objectively, coding can get tedious and/or draining at times, and motivation is not always consistent. There are times where we don't feel that drive or passion to work on projects. And the feeling of wanting to "just get it over with" is something that plagues many of us.

Here are some ways I deal with my lack of motivation and laziness:

- have something I love accompany my coding activities. For example, I always drink milk tea every morning because it's my favorite beverage. I typically code or study documentation while I sip from my cup. This positively reinforces a habit of coding in the morning and gives a "false impression" in my brain that coding is a pleasurable activity. The human psyche is kind of dumb, I know.
- set a consistent schedule for my work. This reduces the burden of decision-making, because I always code at the same time.
- divide my work into smaller tasks. Even if I don't manage to get them all done, I still feel like I accomplished something.
