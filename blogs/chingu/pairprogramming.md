## What is pair programming?

This is for those who are unfamiliar with what pair programming is. If you already know what that is, feel free to skip to the next section.

Pair Programming is a proven technique that helps to improve code quality, transfer knowledge from between developers, and gain valuable collaboration skills and experience. Just as important is the fact that this is a way to learn how other coders approach challenges and how they think.

## Any benefits of signing for weekly matchups?

Through **Chingu Pair Programming** you will:

- Meet a new developer every week to solve coding challenges together
- Take what you know to the next level by sharing your knowledge with others
- Learn new technologies and techniques from your peers

## How does it work?

**Pair Programming Sessions** are _scheduled weekly_ (Wednesday through Tuesday) from the second week of January through the second week of December.

Chingu takes the weekly pair programming signups, and optimizes the matches based on criteria such as time zone, skill level, and technical stack.

## How do I get started?

According to the [Chingu Handbook's Pair Programming Guide](https://docs.chingu.io/pairprog/howwork):

1. If you haven't yet, sign up for [Chingu](https://chingu.io/).
2. You may signup for the next Pair Programming Session using the Pair Programming Match Request form.
3. We'll match you with a partner in a Discord channel just for you, which also contains next steps and tips for success.
4. When your Pair Programming channel is assigned introduce yourself to your partner and set up a time to meet online.
