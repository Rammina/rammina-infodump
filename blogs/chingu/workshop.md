Hello Developers and Designers!

I'm organizing another **FREE Agile & Scrum workshop** with fellow developers and UI/UX/designers on November 1. This will be under Chingu, and certificates of completion will be given to participants.

## TLDR

- What: Agile/Scrum Team workshop
- Where: [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) (remote)
- Why: gain team experience and exchange knowledge
- When: November 1 - December 19
- How: https://chingu.io/howItWorks

- Cost: FREE
- Duration: 6 weeks
- Time commitment: part-time (10-20 hours)
- Reward: certificate of completion, team experience, networking opportunities, knowledge
- Contact: me

## What will we be doing?

We will be a team of 6 members at most, and we will build a web application for 6 weeks while following Agile/Scrum principles. Only part-time commitment is required (10-20 hours/week), as most of us are busy.

The programming languages/libraries used will most likely be:

- JavaScript
- React
- MERN stack

Of course, we can use other languages/libraries if the team chooses to do so.

## What are the goals of the workshop?

### Primary goals:

- allow the participants to gain more team experience
- exchange knowledge with each other
- filling in any learning gaps and correcting bad practices
- provide a networking opportunity to connect with other developers and designers
- build lasting relationships even after the workshop ends

### Secondary Goals:

- successfully build a team project for our portfolio (yeah this is less important than the ones above)
- help each other with interviews/job search (we can do interview practice and resume reviews with each other, but after the workshop)

## General Requirements:

- 10-20 hours/week availability
- Communication skills
- Self-driven learner
- Willingness to work as a team and use collaboration tools
- Humility and receptiveness to feedback
- the closer you are to GMT +8, the better (but any time zone is okay)

### Developer Requirements:

- Capable of building a solo project (Tier 2 in Chingu - check comments)
- React proficiency (MERN is nice to have, but not required)
- CSS/SCSS and HTML proficiency

### Designer Requirements:

- Wireframing tools (Figma or anything similar)
- Knowledge of web design principles
- Willingness to work with a team of developers
